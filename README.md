# NLP-information-retrieval-system
I created an information retrieval system based on "OR", "AND", "AND NOT" and "MULTIPLE AND" operators.

What the notebook is about:
1.   Uploading dataset (CSV file).
2.   Reading the book with `pandas` library.
3.   Tokenizing
   * Implementing documents and queries normalizing method.
   * Implementing posting list (with inverted index).
4.   Implementing operators:
   * OR 
   * AND 
   * AND NOT
   * MULTPLE AND
5.   Implementing Boolean IRS
     * Testing the operators!
